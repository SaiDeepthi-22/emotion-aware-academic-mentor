# 🎓 GenAI Academic Mentor

An intelligent **Streamlit-based academic mentor** that adapts explanations based on a student's **emotional state** such as confusion, stress, confidence, or normal understanding.

This project demonstrates how **Generative AI + Emotion Detection** can create a more personalized and supportive learning experience.

##  Features

✅ Emotion Detection from user input  
✅ Adaptive teaching styles based on emotions  
✅ AI-powered explanations using FLAN-T5  
✅ Quiz Generator  
✅ Personalized Study Plan Creator  
✅ Learning Progress Dashboard  
✅ Clean UI with multiple interactive pages

##  How It Works

The app analyzes the student's input and detects emotion using keyword-based logic:

- **Confused** → Step-by-step slow explanation  
- **Stressed** → Calm, supportive explanation  
- **Confident** → Fast explanation with advanced insights  
- **Normal** → Standard clear explanation  

Then it uses a **Transformer model (`google/flan-t5-base`)** to generate responses accordingly.
